## ü§ñ AI Models Used

### Summarization Model
- **Model**: `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`
- **Purpose**: Creates concise summaries of news articles (30-120 characters)
- **Type**: Distilled BART model optimized for summarization

### Fake News Detection Model
- **Model**: `mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-fake-news-detection`
- **Purpose**: Classifies articles as fake or real with confidence scores
- **Type**: Fine-tuned BERT model specifically trained for fake news detection

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Paste Article**: Copy and paste a news article or paragraph into the text area
2. **Analyze**: Click the "Analyze Article" button
3. **View Results**: 
   - Read the generated summary
   - Check the credibility assessment with confidence percentage
   - View detailed probability scores for fake vs real classification
4. **Download**: Save individual results or entire analysis history
5. **Track History**: View all your previous analyses in the history section

## üìä Output Information

### Summary
- Concise overview of the article content
- Optimized for readability and comprehension

### Credibility Check
- **FAKE**: Article appears to be fake news (with confidence %)
- **REAL**: Article appears to be legitimate news (with confidence %)
- **UNKNOWN**: Credibility is unclear

### Detailed Probabilities
- Shows exact percentages for both fake and real classifications
- Provides transparency in the AI's decision-making process

## üíæ Data Management

### Analysis History

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
Fack_detector/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                 # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml       # Streamlit configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies (optional)
```

## üîß Configuration

The app uses default Streamlit settings. You can customize the appearance by modifying `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#FF6B6B"
backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F0F2F6"
textColor = "#262730"
```

## üö® Important Notes

### Model Limitations
- Models are trained on specific datasets and may not catch all types of misinformation
- Results should be used as a guide, not absolute truth
- Always verify important information through multiple reliable sources

### Data Privacy
- All processing happens locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- Analysis history is stored only in your browser session

### System Requirements
- Requires internet connection for initial model download
- Models will be cached locally after first use
- Recommended: 4GB+ RAM for optimal performance
